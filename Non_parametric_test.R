# Chapter 12, Q19 [13 points] 
# Researchers studying the number of electric fish species living in various parts of the Amazon basin were interested in whether the presence of tributaries affected the 
# local number of electric fish species in the main rivers (Fernandes et al. 2004). They counted the number of electric fish species above and below the entrance point of a 
# major tributary at 12 different river locations. Hereâ€™s what they found: 
# a.	What is the mean difference in the number of species between areas upstream and downstream of a tributary? What is the 95% confidence interval of this mean difference?
# b. Test the hypothesis that the tributaries have no effect on the number of species of electric fish. 
# c. State the assumptions that you had to make to complete parts 
# null hypothesis, correct test, assumption test
